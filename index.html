                <p class="lead text-dark text-center align-middle ps-4"> Reese Ketler's story is one of resillience, determination, and an unwavering commitment to pushing past
                     limits. His life was forever changed during a routine hockey game on Devember 19th, 2019, when he collided head-first into the boards shattering four vertabrae
                     and sustaining a spinal cord injury that left him paralyzed from the chest down, with limited hand function. Refusing to let the injury define him, Reese leaned
                     on his determination, his supportive family including his physiotherapist mother April Gobert, and a tight-knit hockey community that railed around him. Over the
                     months and years that followed, he made remarkable progress, regaining movement in his arms and hands, learning to drive again with adaptive controls, and playing
                     wheelchair rugby for team Canada. Reese documents his day-to-day life through social media where he currently has 200,000+ followers inspiring others daily. Reese's
                     journey is a powerful example of reilience, showing that with hard work and the right support, anything is possible. </p>
